🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot Framework
📝 Overview
This repository provides a simple and reusable rule-based chatbot built using Python. It is designed to be easily extended and adapted to different domains by simply updating the intents and responses. Whether you're creating a customer support bot, FAQ assistant, or a basic conversational interface, this codebase serves as a solid foundation.

📂 Project Structure

.
├── intents.json              # Contains the intents, patterns, and responses
├── main.py                  # Main script to run the chatbot
├── training.py              # Handles preprocessing and model training

⚙️ How It Works
Uses a bag-of-words model with a feedforward neural network to classify user input into predefined intents.

Intent classification is based on training data stored in intents.json.

Returns predefined responses based on predicted intent.

💡 Features
Fully customizable via intents.json

Lightweight and fast — no external APIs required

Easily reusable across different domains (e.g., healthcare, retail, education)

Beginner-friendly and well-structured code

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rule-based-chatbot.git
cd rule-based-chatbot
Install required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy nltk tensorflow
Train the model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python training.py
Run the chatbot:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
🧠 Customization
To adapt the bot for a different domain:

Open intents.json

Add or modify intents like so:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey"],
      "responses": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Greetings!"]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
Then retrain the model using training.py.

🔁 Example Use Cases
FAQ bots for websites

Automated response systems

Educational bots for basic interaction

Domain-specific assistants (e.g., e-commerce, banking, healthcare)

🛠 Future Improvements (Optional)
Add voice input/output

GUI using Tkinter or Streamlit

Integrate with APIs or databases

More advanced NLP using transformers
